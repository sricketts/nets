"Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve."
There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.
Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

"The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon."
"Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage."
Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
"When specific knowledge is taught, it‚Äôs through apprenticeships, not schools."
Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
"Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you."
"Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage."
"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."
Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
"Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity."
"Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest."
The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
You‚Äôre not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

16/ From private truths to public lies. From knowledge to outrage. From positive sum to zero sum.
15/ We are moving from a world where it pays to spread facts to one where it pays to spread opinions. From real goods to signaling goods.
"14/ Economic logic will drive an information business towards signaling goods. They‚Äôre easy to manufacture &amp; share, and pay social rewards."
13/ Campus social action is a signaling good. That‚Äôs why universities are more focused on agreeing what to think than teaching how to think.
12/ Editorial outrage is a signaling good. That‚Äôs why former news outlets have switched from facts to opinions and outrage.
11/ Social media has degenerated into a deafening cacophony of groups signaling and repeating their shared myths.

9/ Every group has a set of shared myths that signal to believers and against outsiders.

"6/ Signaling goods can be physical - handbags, watches, and fancy cars. They can be virtual - political, religious, and tribal affiliations."
5/ Signaling goods signal status and affiliation to the other monkeys. They have value when produced or consumed conspicuously.
